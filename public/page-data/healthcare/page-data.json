On the dashboard a mini hula girl sways her hips to the rhythm of the bumpy gravel driveway. It’s Thursday — the most important day of the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s when Intercambios Puerto Rico, the organization that Román works for, embarks on its weekly journey to provide free primary care and mental health services to people who otherwise wouldn’t have the resources to seek treatment. Most of the people that Intercambios works with are impoverished. Many are homeless, chronic drug users, or both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the team is already there when Román arrives. Jesús Sálamo, the other clinical psychologist on the team, and José Lozada, the nurse, wait by La Móvil, the big, black RV that takes them weekly around the island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intercambios’s logo, a bright yellow stethoscope protruding out of a cyclone, is emblazoned on the side of the vehicle. There’s also a phone number and a listed mission statement: <em>harm reduction, HIV prevention, mental health and substance abuse counseling</em>. Inside, the vehicle resembles a typical doctor’s office that could be found in any brick-and-mortar clinic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intercambios is headquartered in Fajardo, a beach town of just over 11,000 nestled into the northeast corner of the island. The group also deploys a needle exchange program, El Gancho, that runs concurrently with La Móvil on Thursdays.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>El Gancho collects 360,000 used syringes annually — it’s how Intercambios Puerto Rico first got its start back in 2008. Intercambios directly translates to “exchange.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the La Móvil team preps the RV, Frederick Cortés, the coordinator of the El Gancho program, packs supplies into a black Ford Transit van for the day’s trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A five-gallon water cooler sits on the back seat. Three plastic storage boxes are stacked in the back. One contains clean syringes. The second contains mini cookers and alcohol prep pads. The third contains naloxone nasal spray, an overdose reversal medication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to providing care for chronic drug users, Intercambios practices a policy of harm reduction. In contrast to abstinence-based treatment, harm reduction focuses on mitigating risk when it comes to drug use. Harm reduction advocates say providing clean needles and education on safer drug practices can help reduce overdoses and the spread of HIV and Hepatitis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What’s most important is ‘How do we keep this person alive right now?’” Cortés explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the Intercambios can work with a patient to figure out treatment options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately a quarter after 9 a.m. the two teams roll out of the lot. La Móvil ventures 50 minutes east to the town of Caguas. The needle exchange crew heads 40 minutes south down the coast to Yabucoa. Then, stop by stop, they make their way back to Fajardo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[MAP]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Illicit drugs are not hard to come by in Puerto Rico. Because of its geographical location and territory status, the island serves as a key transshipment point for illicit drugs destined for the mainland U.S. If drug cartels from South America and Mexico can get their product onto the island, they can more easily smuggle it into the states without having to deal with customs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to José Antonio Vargas Vidot, a territorial senator and former physician, about 140,000 people are problematic drug users on the island of just over three million. Overdoses have skyrocketed in just the past several years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carmen Albizu-García, a mental health and substance use disorders researcher at the University of Puerto Rico, said that most overdoses that occur on the island are associated with fentanyl. The Puerto Rico Forensic Sciences Institute reports that 97 percent of overdose deaths are fentanyl-related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fentanyl is not a new drug — the analgesic was first manufactured in the 1960s. Since the 1990s it’s been a popular medication for treating chronic pain patients, particularly in people undergoing cancer treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the past decade, fentanyl from China and Mexico has flooded into the black market. It’s an appealing substance for cartels, who can manufacture the synthetic opioid for far cheaper than plant-based heroin, which is derived from the opium poppy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dealers also like fentanyl because of its incredible potency, up to 50 times stronger than heroin. Just a tiny amount can be cut into other common street drugs – heroin, cocaine and pills – to simulate the same euphoric effects for cheap. That also makes fentanyl easier to traffic because dealers can move less of it more discreetly in the form of counterfeit pills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these factors give fentanyl a formidable staying power that both the government and NGOs like Intercambios will be dealing with for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There&#8217;s always market adaptation, and the drug market has a lot of resources,” Albizu-García said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fentanyl’s potency makes it incredibly risky for drug users, particularly those who may not realize they are ingesting it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overdose numbers are reflecting the consequences of the fentanyl boom. Albizu-García said that data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed to a 27-fold increase of opioid deaths from 2017 to 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"replace-interactive\" id=\"fent\">This better be replaced</span>\n\n\n\n<p>2017 was the year that Hurricane Maria devastated the Caribbean, killing nearly 3,000 and causing $90 billion in damage in Puerto Rico. It was also around the time that fentanyl first started to appear on the island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who lost their jobs and homes to the storm were more likely to start using drugs. The toll that Maria, and COVID-19 a couple years later, had on mental health also exacerbated the opioid problem in Puerto Rico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The mental health crisis that Maria (made) impacts directly in the use of drugs,” Sálamo said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who could no longer access service from a healthcare system that had become too stretched thin amidst a shortage of funding and doctors began to look to the streets to find their medication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intercambios workers say that they have witnessed the effects of the fentanyl crisis out in the field. It makes their work more difficult, as drug users who have been injecting for years are suddenly losing their lives at the hands of accidental overdoses. It also makes Intercambios’s work all the more important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping their patients alive is a task that has become harder than ever before for these street doctors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"replace-video\" id=\"health-vid\">This will be replaced</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trio of men are already waiting for the El Gancho van when it pulls up to its usual street corner in Yabucoa. The oldest among them, a man in his late 50s, runs up to the passenger seat window to greet the outreach workers. Once the van parks, the man grabs a folding table out of the back to help the team set up on their corner. It’s become a weekly routine for him at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man in his 50s provides some information to an outreach worker who jots it down on a receipt form. It covers basic information — age, years using injection drugs, how frequently they use drugs on a daily basis. Intercambios doesn’t collect names, just a first and last initial.</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"replace-quote\" id=\"name-here\">Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet, Consetetur Sadipscing Elitr, sed diam nonumy words words words.</span>\n\n\n\n<p>“We focus on providing what are called low threshold services,” Cortés said. “So that means basically having the least amount of obstacles in the person&#8217;s way, or requirements, for them to access care. So I don&#8217;t need to know their real name to be able to provide a syringe.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man in his 50s takes his bag of supplies, thanks the workers and heads out. He’s used injection drugs for at least three decades. It&#8217;s simply not reasonable to expect chronic drug users like him to stop using cold turkey, but enabling users to inject as safely as possible can vastly improve their quality of life and keeps the door open for future treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In certain cases, participants in the El Gancho program may be referred to a case worker at Intercambios. From there, they can receive weekly counseling and treatment to fit their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That interaction is the busiest it gets for the needle exchange crew in Yabucoa. The small southern town is where Maria first made landfall nearly six years ago. The community is still reeling from the devastation of the storm and is noticeably quiet on this particular Thursday morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cortés, sitting legs crossed on the pavement, cuts through the silence by plucking a few tunes on his cuatro. The small, guitar-like instrument is an iconic component of the island’s musical history. He practices out of a tab book of Puerto Rican music. At 11 a.m. the church bells ring, signaling that it’s time for the group to pack up and move on to the next checkpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"replace-section\" id=\"inaccessibility-to-treatment\">This better be replaced</span>\n\n\n\n<p>Years of drug rehabilitation research show that prescription medication is the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder. The two primary methods are methadone and buprenorphine, both of which are opioid class drugs themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Methadone, the oldest and most common of the two treatments, is ingested orally in the form of a fruit-flavored drink. Buprenorphine can come in the form of a pill or film strip that’s placed on the tongue. They are opioid agonists, meaning that they can curb cravings and stop withdrawal symptoms when used properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients seeking Methadone treatment must take it multiple times a week at designated treatment centers, of which there are only six in Puerto Rico. The system operates under a strict set of rules because the supply of methadone is regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration. If a patient misses an appointment they may be booted from the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of these hurdles, it can be extremely difficult for chronic drug users to access treatment, particularly within the impoverished population that Intercambios primarily works with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clinic has a license to provide Suboxone, the brand name for a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, but they only have one physician based out of California to provide telehealth services. One of the Intercambios’s major goals is to hire an on-site physician that can prescribe treatments for OUD.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem? There’s not enough doctors and not enough money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, doctors have been leaving the island in droves to pursue better financial opportunities in the mainland U.S. Nearly half of Puerto Ricans rely on the island’s Medicaid program, which, as in all U.S. territories, is severely underfunded compared to the 50 states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The federal funding that Puerto Rico receives for Medicaid spending comes in the form of a block grant that’s capped at a 55 percent matching rate, despite its per capita income being more than $10,000 less than that of Mississippi, the poorest U.S. state. The federal government matches Mississippi’s medicaid spending at an 84 percent rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Puerto Rico has received sporadic, temporary increases in funding over the past several years thanks to the Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022. But that money will run out in December 2023, plummeting Puerto Rico back down to its artificially low matching rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only will that continue to affect the wages of healthcare workers, but it will also negatively impact prescription drug services on the island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intercambios is able to offer its services free of charge thanks to a grant from Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organization. That grant also stipulates that a physician at Intercambios would be paid $42 an hour, which is at least half of what a doctor could make elsewhere on the island and even less than what they could be making stateside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even those limited resources provided by the grant won’t last after this year. Intercambios is in the process of negotiating a contract to get in network with Vital, the island’s Medicaid program. Getting that contract would help relieve the financial pressure that the clinic faces on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sálamo, one of the physicians at Intercambios, said that he picked up a moonlighting job with the Department of Education to make ends meet. The 42-year-old supports three daughters, and he doesn’t earn enough at Intercambios to comfortably make ends meet.<br><br>Sálamo acknowledged that, with his psychology degree, he could be making much more money elsewhere. But he has no intentions of walking away from his community clinic. The need is too great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If I don’t do it, maybe no one else can do it,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the pay, Sálamo loves the work he does with Intercambios. He welcomes the pressure that comes with providing care in the streets. There’s an excitement to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In school he was taught that a psychological intervention takes about 45 minutes to reach a breakthrough. Out in the field, he says, the job must be finished in the time it takes to smoke a cigarette.</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"replace-section\" id=\"humacao\">This better be replaced</span>\n\n\n\n<p>The blazing sun sits high in the sky when El Gancho and La Móvil reunite in a suburban offshoot of Humacao, right outside the walls of a public housing project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cortés and his crew set their needle exchange station back up behind the RV. Meanwhile, Sálamo conducts some in-home visits in nearby homes. Román and Lazardo attend to participants inside La Móvil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humacao is the busiest stop of the day. Men and women, young and old, come to receive service at the temporary doctors office. Over the years, the group has built up enough trust within the community, among both the drug users and drug dealers which hang around the area, to do their work largely unbothered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One man, Bautista, rides up on his bicycle and gives Róman a warm greeting. Like the man from Yabucoa, Bautista is a man in his 50s who has used drugs for over 30 years. However, Bautista is actively receiving buprenorphine treatment for his addiction, thanks in part to the weekly support he receives from Intercambios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He still occasionally injects cocaine, but Bautista has been off opioids for one year now. He’s also receiving counseling from Róman and has found permanent housing, something he didn’t have the luxury of just a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the journey has been long and arduous. And it’s one without a clear destination as Bautista continues to struggle with poverty and the temptations of drug use in his neighborhood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cutting ties with the drug users he associates with has been one of the hardest lifestyle changes he’s had to make in his recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Every corner is the same,” he says with a wise grin and slight twinkle in his eye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a check in with Román, Bautista thanks the Intercambios crew and rides away on his bike. His future isn’t certain, but it’s less bleak than it used to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Román and some of the La Móvil crew break away to a local Japanese restaurant for a late-afternoon lunch. Most Thursdays, a group lunch is necessary for the team to de-escalate amid an intense work day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the break, there’s one last stop that Román and Lazardo, the nurse, need to make — a scheduled in-home visit with one of their patients. Joseph, a middle-aged drug user, suffers from large skin ulcers on both of his forearms that have been caused by dangerous injection practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Severe swelling has made mobility an issue for Joseph. Román worries that, if left untreated for too long, he may lose one or both of his arms to amputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph is already getting into the driver’s seat of his pickup truck as the Intercambios van rolls up to his house. Román gets out to talk, but it’s already too late. Joseph explains that he needs to drive his uncle to a separate medical appointment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be no treatment today on this Thursday — it’ll have to be pushed back to sometime in the next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For today, we’ve lost Joseph,” Román says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By now, the sun has started to dip in the sky. That was the final stop of the day. Román gets into the van and drives back into Fajardo to reconnect with the rest of his coworkers at the Intercambios clinic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a week’s time, the crew will do it all over again. The cycle repeats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subheaders</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More history with Intercmbios why did they blow up? </p>\n\n\n","title":"HEALTHCARE","date":"March 16, 2023","featuredImage":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNQ==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDo1OA==","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["337003659","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
