On the dashboard a mini hula girl swayed her hips to the rhythm of the bumpy gravel driveway. It’s Thursday — the biggest day of the week for the clinical psychologist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s when Intercambios Puerto Rico, the organization that Román works for, embarks on its weekly journey to provide free primary care and mental health services to people who otherwise wouldn’t have the resources to seek treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intercambios is headquartered in Fajardo, a beach town of just over 11,000 nestled into the northeast corner of the island. Most of the people that Intercambios works with are impoverished. Many are homeless, chronic drug users — or both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the mainland U.S., Puerto Rico is dealing with the consequences of the fentanyl crisis. The island’s health care system, which has become strained as a result of a tattered economy and destruction wrought by Hurricane Maria, cannot provide care to the people who need it most. NGOs, like Intercambios, can help fill those gaps in service.</p>\n","title":"SALUD","date":"April 17, 2023","featuredImage":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyMDA=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyMDQ=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxMjQ="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1693042298","848497233"],"slicesMap":{}}
